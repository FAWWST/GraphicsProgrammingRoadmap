# My Computer Graphics Programming Roadmap
This is a project with the sole purpose of containing learning resources & reminding myself of what I need to learn in order to become a graphics engineer. 

I might also make the same thing on my [Website](https://j-2k.github.io).

#  Prerequisites - Important!
1. Linear Algebra
2. Trigonometry
3. C++

## Main Roadmap for myself:
#### (in brackets will mark a resource I chose to follow & learn with)
Emoji Keys = ‚úîÔ∏è Completed, ‚åõ In Progress, ‚ùå Not Started
1. Write a software raytracer. ‚úîÔ∏è (Cherno Raytracing Series) 
2. Write a software rasterizer. ‚ùå (SSloy Tiny rasterizer)
3. The Triangle stage, use OpenGL. ‚ùå
4. Create a project with the Graphics API of choice (OpenGL, Vulkan, or DX12) & Render 1 Mesh with lighting. ‚ùå

By here we are done technically, & now we just have to be passionate & make something or explore other topics such as:  
PBR (Physically Based Rendering).   
PPFX (Post Processing Effects like AO (Ambient Occlusion)).  
Shaders (Ray-marching fun or Fast Fourier transform for insane water).  
This can go on forever but by here we can do whatever as long as we are learning, I personally, will have my next steps below.  

#### Fun Section (How I will be continuing)  
5. Create a graphics-focused Minecraft Sim with any Graphics API.  
6. [Extras] Extend the Minecraft Sim to feature the following/any:  
+ Lighting & Water Shader
+ Any Post Processing Effects (Motion blur / Ambient Occlusion / Depth of Field / Bloom / etc.)
+ Multithreading / GPU-Acceleration <br>

## Resources
#### Prerequisites Resources

***Prerequisite Note:***  
*Learn the Math it's the one and only thing important, especially when it comes to graphics programming.*  
*If "Person A" knew so much C++ but didn't know much of the math in graphics & "Person B" ONLY knew the math but no C++ "Person B" would fly through graphics.*  
*üëã Good luck on becoming a graphics engineer.*

- [Immersive Mathemathics](https://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html#), Learn math needed through a website that shows mathematics in an immersive 3D environment.
- [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) Learning Linear Transformations, & see how they move in space via video (3blue1brown).
- [Cherno C++ Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb) Chernos C++ Series for the pre-requisite section
- [Scratchapixel](https://scratchapixel.com) Learn computer graphics topics & all math prerequisites.

#### Main Roadmap Resources
- [Beginner Computer Graphics Starter Guide](https://erkaman.github.io/posts/beginner_computer_graphics.html) Erkaman's guide on starting Computer Graphics.
- [Art of Code Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheArtofCodeIsCool) For learning & Writing better shaders using GLSL on Shadertoy (Easily transferable to HLSL/CG).
- [Cherno Raytracing Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98edc5GshdBtREv5asFW3yXl) Cherno Raytracing Guide that im following.
- [Raytracing in 1 Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io) Infamous book for learning raytracing.
- [Scratchapixel](https://scratchapixel.com) Learn computer graphics topics & all math prerequisites.
- [ssloy](https://github.com/ssloy) More guides about CG topics from ssloy
- [Cherno OpenGL Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) Learn OpenGL from Chernos OpenGL Series (Probably really old but whatever)
- [Vulkan Game Engine Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR) Learn Vulkan from Brendan Galea (Optional choice to OpenGL with the benefit that its more updated & its a better graphics specialization, however is difficult for beginners)
- [Real Time Rendering](https://realtimerendering.com/) Core book for Real-Time Graphics

#### Extras
- [Catlike Coding](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) Probably the best shader tutorials out there. It's a crime that I forgot to put this in.
- [Graphics Programming Github Page](https://graphics-programming.org/resources/) Made up from people of the Graphics Programming Discord Server.
- [LearnDXD11](https://graphicsprogramming.github.io/learnd3d11/1-introduction/1-1-getting-started/1-1-3-hello-triangle/) Learn DirectX11, same authors as above link.
- [Big Randy Resources (Not just Graphics)](https://github.com/bigrando420/resources/wiki) Big Randy's resources are actually pretty good too.
- [DirectX Tutorial](http://www.directxtutorial.com/Lesson.aspx?lessonid=11-4-1) Seem's a little old but still pretty good, can be subbed out for LearnDXD11 above. Pick your poison.


##### Miscellaneous
- [MathIsFun.com Trigonometry](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trigonometry.html) For Learning Trigonometry & can literally be used to learn everything in the prereqs & other math related topics that come later on in graphics.
- Getting A Masters Degree in Computer Science with the final project (the thesis or dissertation whatever the place you choose calls it) based on something related to graphics. This note is for myself, because it sounds fun might do it. Ideas for final project could be a Minecraft Sim / a good raytracer / Voxel Engine & etc.<br>

##### Final Notes
Will probably add more stuff here, but I have to mention it's extremely important to find out what you want to do in life, specifically if it's graphics then what with graphics?<br>
Games Industry? Positions that exist are:<br>
- Technical Artist/Shader Developer (Maybe even VFX position, dealing with particles & shaders).
- Graphics Engineer / Engine & Graphics Developer. <br>
(These are the main positions I look for, many other positions also exist just check the image below by hitmarker.)
- Possibly even a research based position if you get really good & can land a place @ NVIDIA. <br>
Adding this image for you to see more positions that a graphics dev can also work on alongside pursuing graphics. This image was not made by me, credits go to people @ [hitmarker.net](https://hitmarker.net/).

Movies Industry? I don't really know/care about them, so I won't talk about it here. But I heard there are opportunities over there also for graphics people.
