# My Computer Graphics Programming Roadmap
This is a project with the sole purpose of containing learning resources & reminding myself of what I need to learn in order to become a graphics engineer. 

I might also make the same thing on my [Website](https://j-2k.github.io).

#  Prerequisites - Important!
1. Linear Algebra
2. Trigonometry
3. C++

## My Current plan for myself:
1. Write a raytracer.
2. Learn OpenGL.
3. Create OpenGL project & Render 1 Mesh with lighting.
4. [Optional/Always] Get better with OpenGL & Writing Shaders (HLSL/GLSL/CG).
5. [Final] Create Minecraft Simulator with OpenGL.
6. [Extras] Extend the Minecraft Sim to feature the following/any:
+ Lighting
+ Water Shader
+ Any Post Processing Effects (Motion blur / Ambient Occlusion / Depth of Field / etc.)
+ Multithreading / GPU-Acceleration
